# Quickstart Validation: Conan-Free Build

**Feature**: Remove Conan Dependency  
**Date**: 2025-10-17  
**Purpose**: Validate that builds work without Conan on clean system

---

## Prerequisites

### System Requirements
- macOS (Apple Silicon or Intel) OR Linux (ubuntu-22.04 or similar)
- Internet connection (for Homebrew package downloads)

### Required Software
- **Git**: To clone repository
- **Homebrew**: Package manager for macOS/Linux
  - macOS: Should be pre-installed or install from https://brew.sh
  - Linux: Install Linuxbrew from https://brew.sh

---

## Part 1: Clean System Setup (macOS)

### Step 1.1: Install Prerequisites
```bash
# Install Homebrew if not present (macOS typically has it)
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

# Install GStreamer 1.26+
brew install gstreamer

# Install CMake 3.27+
brew install cmake

# Verify installations
gstreamer-1.0 --version  # Should show >= 1.26
cmake --version          # Should show >= 3.27
```

**Expected Output**:
- GStreamer version 1.26.x or higher
- CMake version 3.27.x or higher

**Success Criteria**: ✅ Both commands print version numbers meeting requirements

---

### Step 1.2: Clone Repository
```bash
# Clone from GitHub
git clone https://github.com/KartikAiyer/gst_pre_record_loop.git
cd gst_pre_record_loop

# Switch to feature branch
git checkout 003-remove-conan-currently
```

**Expected Output**:
- Repository cloned successfully
- Branch switched message

**Success Criteria**: ✅ You are in the repository root with feature branch checked out

---

### Step 1.3: Verify No Conan Installation
```bash
# This should fail or show Conan is not installed
conan --version 2>/dev/null || echo "Conan not found (expected)"
```

**Expected Output**:
```
Conan not found (expected)
```

**Success Criteria**: ✅ Conan is NOT installed (we're validating Conan-free build)

---

## Part 2: Build Validation (Debug Configuration)

### Step 2.1: Configure Debug Build
```bash
# Use CMake preset for debug configuration
cmake --preset=debug
```

**Expected Output**:
```
-- The C compiler identification is AppleClang X.X.X (or GNU on Linux)
-- The CXX compiler identification is AppleClang X.X.X (or GNU on Linux)
-- Detecting GStreamer...
-- Found GStreamer: /opt/homebrew/lib/libgstreamer-1.0.dylib (found version "1.26.x")
-- Configuring done
-- Generating done
-- Build files have been written to: .../build/Debug
```

**Success Criteria**: 
- ✅ Configuration completes without errors
- ✅ GStreamer 1.26+ detected
- ✅ Build directory created at `build/Debug/`
- ✅ NO references to Conan or conanfile.py in output

**Failure Modes**:
- ❌ "GStreamer not found" → Run `brew install gstreamer` and retry
- ❌ "CMake 3.27 required" → Run `brew upgrade cmake` and retry
- ❌ "Preset 'debug' not found" → Verify CMakePresets.json exists in repo root

---

### Step 2.2: Build Debug Configuration
```bash
# Build using CMake build preset
cmake --build --preset=debug --parallel 6
```

**Expected Output**:
```
[  5%] Building C object gstprerecordloop/CMakeFiles/gstprerecordloop.dir/src/gstprerecordloop.c.o
[ 10%] Linking C shared library libgstprerecordloop.dylib
[ 15%] Built target gstprerecordloop
...
[100%] Built target prerec_unit_queue_pruning
```

**Success Criteria**:
- ✅ All targets build without errors
- ✅ Plugin built: `build/Debug/gstprerecordloop/libgstprerecordloop.dylib` (or .so on Linux)
- ✅ Test binaries built in `build/Debug/tests/`
- ✅ Test app built: `build/Debug/testapp/prerec.app/Contents/MacOS/prerec` (macOS)

**Failure Modes**:
- ❌ Compilation errors → Check GStreamer headers are accessible
- ❌ Linking errors → Check GStreamer libraries are accessible
- ❌ "build preset not found" → Verify buildPresets in CMakePresets.json

---

### Step 2.3: Run Tests (Debug)
```bash
# Run all tests using ctest
ctest --test-dir build/Debug --output-on-failure
```

**Expected Output**:
```
Test project .../build/Debug
      Start  1: prerec_unit_queue_lifecycle
 1/22 Test  #1: prerec_unit_queue_lifecycle ..........   Passed    0.01 sec
      Start  2: prerec_unit_queue_pruning
 2/22 Test  #2: prerec_unit_queue_pruning ............   Passed    0.02 sec
...
     Start 22: prerec_memory_leaks_basic
22/22 Test #22: prerec_memory_leaks_basic ............   Passed    0.15 sec

100% tests passed, 0 tests failed out of 22
```

**Success Criteria**:
- ✅ **All 22 tests pass** (FR-008)
- ✅ No memory leaks reported in memory test (FR-010)
- ✅ Test execution time reasonable (< 5 seconds total)

**Failure Modes**:
- ❌ Test failures → Check test output, may indicate GStreamer version mismatch
- ❌ Segmentation faults → Check GStreamer plugin loading paths

---

## Part 3: Build Validation (Release Configuration)

### Step 3.1: Configure Release Build
```bash
cmake --preset=release
```

**Expected Output**:
Similar to debug configure, but with `build/Release/` directory.

**Success Criteria**:
- ✅ Configuration completes without errors
- ✅ Build directory created at `build/Release/`

---

### Step 3.2: Build Release Configuration
```bash
cmake --build --preset=release --parallel 6
```

**Expected Output**:
Similar to debug build, with release optimizations applied.

**Success Criteria**:
- ✅ All targets build without errors
- ✅ Plugin and tests built in `build/Release/`

---

### Step 3.3: Run Tests (Release)
```bash
ctest --test-dir build/Release --output-on-failure
```

**Expected Output**:
```
100% tests passed, 0 tests failed out of 22
```

**Success Criteria**:
- ✅ **All 22 tests pass in Release** (FR-009)

---

## Part 4: Plugin Registration Validation

### Step 4.1: Inspect Plugin with gst-inspect-1.0
```bash
# Set plugin path to our build
export GST_PLUGIN_PATH="$(pwd)/build/Debug/gstprerecordloop:$GST_PLUGIN_PATH"

# Inspect the plugin
gst-inspect-1.0 pre_record_loop
```

**Expected Output**:
```
Factory Details:
  Rank                     none (0)
  Long-name                Pre-Record Loop Buffer
  Klass                    Filter/Video
  Description              Maintains a ring buffer for pre-event recording
  Author                   [Author Name]

Plugin Details:
  Name                     prerecordloop
  Description              Pre-Record Loop GStreamer Plugin
  Filename                 .../build/Debug/gstprerecordloop/libgstprerecordloop.dylib
  Version                  1.0.0
  License                  [License]
  Source module            gst-prerecordloop
  Binary package           GStreamer Pre-Record Loop
  Origin URL               [URL]

[Properties, Pad Templates, etc. listed...]
```

**Success Criteria**:
- ✅ Plugin loads successfully (FR-017)
- ✅ Factory details match expected values
- ✅ Properties listed correctly

**Failure Modes**:
- ❌ "No such element or plugin" → Check GST_PLUGIN_PATH is set correctly
- ❌ Plugin loads but crashes → Check GStreamer version compatibility

---

## Part 5: Documentation Validation

### Step 5.1: Verify README Accuracy
```bash
# Check README prerequisites section
grep -A 5 "Prerequisites" README.md
```

**Expected Content** (FR-018, FR-019, FR-028):
```markdown
## Prerequisites
- GStreamer 1.26+ via Homebrew (required)
  - macOS: `brew install gstreamer`
  - Linux: Install Homebrew/Linuxbrew, then `brew install gstreamer`
- CMake 3.27+ (required)
- pkg-config (included with Homebrew)
```

**Success Criteria**:
- ✅ GStreamer 1.26+ mentioned as first prerequisite
- ✅ Homebrew installation method documented
- ✅ CMake 3.27+ requirement stated
- ✅ NO mention of Conan anywhere in README

**Validation Command**:
```bash
# This should find ZERO matches
grep -i "conan" README.md && echo "FAIL: Conan still mentioned" || echo "PASS: No Conan references"
```

---

### Step 5.2: Verify Build Commands Match Reality
Extract build commands from README and verify they match what we just executed:

```bash
# Commands from README should be:
# 1. cmake --preset=debug
# 2. cmake --build --preset=debug
# 3. ctest --test-dir build/Debug

# Verify these are documented
grep "cmake --preset" README.md
grep "cmake --build --preset" README.md
grep "ctest --test-dir" README.md
```

**Success Criteria**:
- ✅ README documents exact commands used in this quickstart
- ✅ Commands are copy-paste executable

---

## Part 6: Linux-Specific Validation (If Applicable)

If testing on Linux (ubuntu-22.04):

### Step 6.1: Install Linuxbrew and GStreamer
```bash
# Install Linuxbrew
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

# Add Homebrew to PATH (add to ~/.bashrc for persistence)
eval "$(/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin/brew shellenv)"

# Install dependencies
brew install gstreamer cmake

# Verify
gst-launch-1.0 --version
cmake --version
```

### Step 6.2: Repeat Parts 2-5
Follow same steps as macOS:
- Configure debug/release
- Build debug/release
- Run tests (all 22 must pass)
- Validate plugin registration

**Linux-Specific Success Criteria**:
- ✅ Plugin builds as `.so` (not `.dylib`)
- ✅ Tests pass identically to macOS
- ✅ Valgrind memory tests pass (if valgrind installed)

### Step 6.3: CI Validation Sign-Off

**Platform**: ubuntu-22.04 and macos-latest (GitHub Actions)  
**Date**: 2025-10-17

## Part 7: CI Simulation (Local)

### Step 7.1: Run CI Script Locally
```bash
# Make script executable
chmod +x .ci/run-tests.sh

# Run CI script (simulates GitHub Actions)
bash .ci/run-tests.sh
```

**Expected Output**:
```
=== Building Debug Configuration ===
=== Running Debug Tests ===
...
=== Building Release Configuration ===
=== Running Release Tests ===
...
✅ All tests passed!
```

**Success Criteria**:
- ✅ Script completes without errors
- ✅ Both Debug and Release builds tested
- ✅ NO Conan-related commands executed

**Validation**:
```bash
# Verify script doesn't call Conan
grep -i "conan" .ci/run-tests.sh && echo "FAIL: Conan in script" || echo "PASS: No Conan in script"

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: CMake preset not found
**Symptom**: `CMake Error: No such preset in ...`  
**Solution**: 
1. Verify `CMakePresets.json` exists in repository root
2. Check preset name matches (case-sensitive: "debug" not "Debug")
3. Verify CMake version >= 3.27

### Issue: GStreamer not found
**Symptom**: `Could NOT find PkgConfig (missing: GStreamer)`  
**Solution**:
1. Install GStreamer: `brew install gstreamer`
2. Verify pkg-config: `brew install pkg-config`
3. Check PKG_CONFIG_PATH includes Homebrew paths

### Issue: Tests fail on clean system
**Symptom**: Tests pass locally but fail in quickstart  
**Solution**:
1. Check GStreamer version matches (>= 1.26)
2. Verify plugin loads: `GST_PLUGIN_PATH=... gst-inspect-1.0 pre_record_loop`
3. Check for stale build artifacts: `rm -rf build/`

### Issue: Plugin not found by gst-inspect-1.0
**Symptom**: `No such element or plugin 'pre_record_loop'`  
**Solution**:
1. Verify GST_PLUGIN_PATH is set correctly
2. Check plugin binary exists: `ls build/Debug/gstprerecordloop/libgstprerecordloop.*`
3. Verify plugin has GStreamer metadata: `nm -g <plugin_file> | grep gst_plugin`
